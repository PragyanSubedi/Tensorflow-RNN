# Tensorflow-RNN
Houses RNN projects done using TensorFlow.

## Manual RNN

 3 neuron RNN layer. 2 batches of data, t=0 and t=1
 
 x0 -> 3 neurons -> y0 and x1 -> 3 neurons -> y1 
 
 Each Recurrent Neuron as 2 sets of weights. Wx for input weight on X, Wy for weights on output of original X.
   
## Time Series RNN

Predicts the new value a sine function is going to plot out.
